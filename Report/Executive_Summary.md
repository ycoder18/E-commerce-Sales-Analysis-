Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive performance review of Wisdom Pets’ e-commerce operations using historical sales, customer, and product data. We focus on four strategic domains: sales trends, product-level performance, pricing and profitability, and customer segmentation. The purpose is to uncover key patterns, identify bottlenecks, and recommend actions to strengthen business outcomes.

1. Sales Trend Analysis

We analyzed the revenue movement across time to identify sales patterns, peaks, and low-performing periods. The data shows that:

1.1 Peak Revenue Periods: November and December consistently generated the highest revenue. In particular, November recorded peak sales totaling $250,000, likely due to seasonal demand and year-end promotions.

1.2 Revenue Drop Zones: January and February had significantly lower revenue, with January totaling just $68,000 and February at $72,500, suggesting a post-holiday slowdown and opportunity for re-engagement campaigns.

1.3 Weekly Trends: Sales were higher on weekends (especially Saturdays), averaging $12,500 per Saturday, confirming increased leisure-time shopping behavior.

Recommended Actions: Launch Q1 marketing campaigns to boost off-peak periods, implement weekday flash sales to even out traffic, and align inventory cycles with high-demand months.

2. Product-Level Performance

We evaluated products based on sales volume, revenue contribution, and customer ratings.

2.1 Best-Sellers: Products in the "Care" category such as grooming kits and nutritional supplements led in both revenue and units sold. The top product, "Omega Chew Supplement," sold over 2,300 units, generating $57,500 in revenue.

2.2 Revenue by Category: The "Care" category contributed the most revenue at $525,000, followed by "Vaccines" at $312,000, which had fewer transactions but higher average order values ($75 per transaction).

2.3 Performance Mismatch: Some low-rated products continued to sell at high volume. For example, "Anti-Itch Spray" with a 2.9 rating still sold 1,200+ units, likely due to pricing and necessity.

Recommended Actions: Bundle top-selling products to drive higher average order value (AOV), promote underperforming high-rated products through strategic placements, and improve descriptions of low-rated but high-selling items to reduce returns and improve satisfaction.

3. Strategic Pricing & Profitability Review

This section focused on analyzing how pricing and discount strategies affect overall profitability.

3.1 High-Volume, Low-Profit Products: A subset of 5 products with average discounts of 25–30% drove traffic but offered minimal margins, collectively bringing in $84,000 in revenue with an estimated margin of only 12%.

3.2 Discount Effectiveness: Some items with modest discounts (under 10%) like "Dental Chew Treats" generated higher net profit compared to heavily discounted items.

3.3 Category Margins: "Care" products averaged 22% profit margin, whereas accessories varied between 10% and 18%, showing higher pricing instability.

Recommended Actions: Rebalance discount strategies to prioritize margin contribution, adopt customer-tiered pricing for loyalty members, and monitor price sensitivity through A/B testing for new or fluctuating SKUs.

4. Customer Behavior & Segmentation

Customer segmentation allowed us to differentiate behaviors and contributions between VIP and non-VIP groups.

4.1 VIP Revenue Share: VIP customers accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue ($480,000 out of $1.2M) and displayed consistently higher AOV ($92 vs $56) and repeat frequency (4.2 vs 2.3 transactions per customer).

4.2 Non-VIP Trends: Regular customers had a churn rate of 34% and lower lifetime value, with average spending of just $120 per year.

4.3 Geographical Insights: Sales were concentrated in metro postal codes like 90210 and 94103, each contributing over $45,000 annually, revealing underserved regions with under $8,000 in annual sales.

Recommended Actions: Scale the VIP program with tiered rewards, implement geo-targeted marketing in underperforming regions, and re-engage dormant customers via personalized campaigns and time-bound offers.

5. Business Growth Opportunities

Based on the analysis, we identified several actionable business improvements:

Seasonal Campaigns: Use gift card promotions and loyalty points in Q1 to counteract post-holiday drop-offs; target a 15% revenue lift.

Bundling Strategy: Introduce kits of high-demand complementary products to increase order size by 18–22%.

Loyalty Program Expansion: Offer exclusive previews, discounts, and cashback to VIP customers, aiming to increase their retention rate by 10–12%.

Smart Discounting: Focus discounts on products with high price elasticity and strong margins, potentially boosting profits by $25,000+ annually.

Portfolio Enhancement: Introduce 8–10 new product lines in low-competition categories like natural remedies and oral health.
