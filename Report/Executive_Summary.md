### 1. Sales Trend Analysis

We analyzed the revenue movement across time to identify sales patterns, peaks, and low-performing periods. The data shows that:

- **Peak Revenue Periods**: November and December consistently generated the highest revenue. November recorded peak sales totaling **$250K**, likely due to seasonal demand and year-end promotions.
- **Revenue Drop Zones**: January and February had significantly lower revenue, with totals of **$68K** and **$72.5K** respectively, suggesting a post-holiday slowdown.
- **Weekly Trends**: Sales were higher on weekends (especially Saturdays), averaging **$12.5K per Saturday**.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Launch Q1 marketing campaigns to boost off-peak periods  
- Implement weekday flash sales to even out traffic  
- Align inventory with high-demand months

### 2. Product-Level Performance

We evaluated products based on sales volume, revenue contribution, and customer ratings.

- **Best-Sellers**: Products in the "Care" category (e.g., grooming kits, supplements) led in revenue and units sold. The top product, *Omega Chew Supplement*, sold **2,300+ units**, generating **$57.5K**.
- **Revenue by Category**: The "Care" category contributed **$525K**, followed by "Vaccines" at **$312K**. Vaccines had fewer transactions but higher average order values (**$75**).
- **Performance Mismatch**: Low-rated items like *Anti-Itch Spray* (rating: 2.9) still sold **1,200+ units**, possibly due to necessity or pricing.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Bundle top-selling products to increase AOV

### 3. Strategic Pricing & Profitability Review

This section focused on analyzing how pricing and discount strategies affect profitability.

- **High-Volume, Low-Profit Products**: 5 products with **25â€“30% discounts** brought in **$84K** in revenue but had a margin of only **12%**.
- **Discount Effectiveness**: Items with lower discounts (â‰¤10%) like *Dental Chew Treats* yielded better net profit than heavier discounts.
- **Category Margins**: "Care" products averaged **22%** profit margin, while accessories ranged from **10â€“18%**, showing greater pricing inconsistency.

**Recommended Actions:**

Segmentation helped us analyze differences between VIP and regular customers.

- **VIP Revenue Share**: VIPs contributed **40%** of total revenue (**$480K of $1.2M**), with higher AOV (**$92 vs $56**) and more frequent purchases (**4.2 vs 2.3**).
- **Non-VIP Trends**: Regular customers had a **34% churn rate** and spent only **$120/year** on average.
- **Geographical Insights**: Metro postal codes like **90210** and **94103** each generated **$45K+**, while some regions brought in less than **$8K/year**.

**Recommended Actions:**
